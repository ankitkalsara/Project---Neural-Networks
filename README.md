Note: Currently path is set for picking dataset for "train.csv" file. In order to run the code with another dataset, please update line# 22 of Driver.java file (String csvFile = workingDir + "\\train.csv")

We have devloped Artifical Neural Network for simple perceptron. This model can host unlimited number of input neurons, hidden neurons (middle layer) and output neurons.
Developed ANN will be trained multiple times and then asked to predict the output. 
We have implemented Backpropagation technique which will adjust the weights of input and hidden nodes during each training data.
